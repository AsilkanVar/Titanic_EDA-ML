# Titanic_EDA-ML
Explonaratory data analysis and applied machine learning techniques on Titanic dataset which is provided from Kaggle. 

I used 10 ML techniques which are :

    * KNN
    * Logistic Regression
    * Gaussian Naive Bayes
    * Support Vector Classifier
    * Classification and Regression Trees
    * Random Forest
    * Gradient Boosting Machine
    * Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost)
    * Light GBM
    * CatBoost
    
You can also download the dataset which is inside "dataset" file within a zip format.

For my submission with XGBoost on Kaggle competition, you can visit https://www.kaggle.com/asilkanv/titanic-eda-ml.com/asilkanv/titanic-eda-ml and look at the last part of notebook.
